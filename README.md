# Functional Programming

*Functional Programming, a course of the Tech-track of Information Design, thema semester of the third year from the study CMD. In this course I will learn to clean raw data so it becomes usable.*

### Deliverable

An interesting research case and question based on parking data in cities in The Netherlands, including a digital data visualisation.

*The client for this assignment is [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a very popular and big Dutch newspaper*

## Research Question

### Which city is best to park with an electric car ?

*For this question I assume that parking facilities with electric car are mostly in bigger cities, and that these spaces will be more expensive than parking spaces without support for electric car charging*

**Sub questions**

* How many electric car charging parking spots are available for electric cars?

*I'm assuming that there are more electric car charging parking spots in prosperous cities*

* Where is the most support for electric car charging in parking facilities?

*I'm assuming that there is more support in bigger cities like Amsterdam or Utrecht than smaller cities.*

* How expensive is the parking facility?

*My assumption is that the parking facilities with support for electric car charging are more expensive than parking facilities without support for electric car charging.*

#### What data am I going to need?

* [Charging points in parking facilities](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)
* [Tarifs of parking facilities](https://github.com/StanBankras/functional-programming/blob/7b103e400c03b80f58c1b2a4acc710a336ca5951/src/js/index.js#L70-L129) with huge credits to [Stan Bankras](https://github.com/StanBankras/) for creating the function for this
